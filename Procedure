S3 Image Processing Using Lambda Function:

* Image Upload:
   I upload an image to the input bucket (input-images-5f84d02ebaa575b7).

* S3 Event Notification:
   S3 sends an event (e.g., s3:ObjectCreated:*) to AWS Lambda.
   This event is triggered automatically because the Lambda function is set as an event listener for object creation in the input bucket.

* Lambda Execution:
   The function downloads the image from the input bucket (Lambda function is created automatically via Terraform).

* Image Processing:
   The Lambda function processes the image (e.g., resizing, compressing, etc.).

* Upload to Processed Bucket:
  The processed image is uploaded to the output bucket (processed-images-5f84d02ebaa575b7).

* No Manual Trigger Needed:
   Automation: Once the infrastructure is deployed with Terraform, the process is fully automated and event driven.

* No Manual Execution:
   There is no need to manually trigger the Lambda function, it automatically processes the image whenever a new file is uploaded to the input bucket.
